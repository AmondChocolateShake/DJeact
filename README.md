# Goal
- [ ] be able to Create a UI by this
- [ ] Implement Virtual DOM
- [ ] Implement Component with State
- [ ] Implement JSX
- [ ] Build my own website by using this


# Principles of React
1. Virtual DOM and Key
2. Context
3. JSX
4. Props
5. State
6. Life Cycle


# How React works?
1. Bundler parses JSX -> createElement (This is very interesting that bunders manage JSX Parsing 🤔)
2. createElement creates Object for Virtual DOM
3. (If DOM manipulation is required depending on the status, the changed areas are compared through the virtual dom diff algorithm and a new object is created. ref : https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)
4. Virtual DOM creates real DOM
